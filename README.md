## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, install `rvm` and run `rvm use`. Then run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Running the `run` file will start a local webserver listening on port 4242 which you can use to access any defined webpages

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are not welcome since we're kinda doing our own thing and just don't want to pay for a private repo
